## Experimental HTMX setup

Experiment with getting consistent up to date
time and location data for posted content

### Functionality if you're generous

node http server *needs https?*
Async file operations *promisify!*
ftp *needs sftp*

setting up vibes to decay over time on the *wave* set as
slow-early
fast-late
*moved to second priority after:*
track locations and distance from time of creation

### Ongoing

- eyebleed landing page css currently testing tailwind
- waves page needs to ==read== EXISTING blocks first
- htmx not keeping the connection open and reading after creating a block
- - though thats difficult to test for me
- cUrl api requests will fail and then read back data but not after a disconnect and reconnect?
